# Skript

### Overview
Some servers may come equipped with Skript protection. This can range from simple griefing commands to completely eliminating the chances of griefing.

### Popular protections
Some popular protections are:
* WorldEdit Brush, World Transform commands
* Plugman Commands
* Broadcasts with the word "Hacked", "Grief", etc.
* Disabling Skript

### Bypassing
The most popular bypassing is with writing `<plugin>:<command> <arguments>`

For example:

The command `/br sphere 0 5` is protected,
to bypass it you can use `/worldedit:br sphere 0 5` or `/we:br sphere 0 5`

### Experimenting
If you already have administrator priviliges, you can bring on an alt account to test the protection.
