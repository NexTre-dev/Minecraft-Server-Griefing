# AuthMeBridge

### Overview
AuthMeBridge is a plugin that acts like a bridge between spigot/bukkit servers and a BungeeCord instance.

### Analyzing
The way AuthMeBridge works, is when the user logs in, it automatically executes a command for the user, sending the user to the server specified.

### Exploiting
By typing `/server <server>`, AuthMeBridge will automatically send you to the server you specified, without needing to login
