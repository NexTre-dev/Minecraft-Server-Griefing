##### UUID Spoofing only works for servers with `online-mode` turned on.
##### UUID Spoofing is not a bug in protocols or server software. The way spigot handles handshake packets is the reason this exploit can exist.

# UUID Spoofing
UUID Spoofing is a vulnerability in bungeecord, where a user can gain administrator priviliges on vulnerable Minecraft servers.

### UUID
UUID stands for `Unique User Identifier` and each unique UUID is identifying a player.

### Spoofing
Simplyfing down on how it works, UUID Spoofing basically uses offline Mojang authentication servers instead of online one, and modifies a TCP packet handshake to whatever. This causes the player to log on the server using a bungeecord sub server.

### Exploiting
You can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrator priviliges on any Minecraft server that don't host sub servers locally.

Some popular clients with build in UUID Spoofing:
* Dymeth Client (CheatMine Client)
* EaZy
* SkillClient
* LiquidBounce
* Remix
