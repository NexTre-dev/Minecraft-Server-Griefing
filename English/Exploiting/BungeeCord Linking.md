# BungeeCord Linking

### Overview
BungeeCord linking is the act of running an isolated server on the same computer node the victim's server is ran on, and linking the victim's server address to your's in BungeeCord.

### Analyzing
If you find a server with a host that runs multiple servers on 1 node _(ex.: Server A and Server B are running on the same machine, despite having different gamemodes, different names, different owners, etc.)_, and you can get the internal IP addresses of the server, you can host a server on the **same** node, link it with your BungeeCord.

### Exploiting
Typing `/server <server>` into chat after you linked it will automatically send you to the server you specified, without having to go through the login process.
