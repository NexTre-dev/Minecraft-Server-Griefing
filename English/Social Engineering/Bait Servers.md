###### This trick will only work if the victim's server has AuthMe installed.

# Bait Servers

### Overview
Using bait servers, smaller server owners **may** enter their real password on your server.

### Exploiting
Create a new server, any free hosting will do. Build a simple spawn or any structure. Install 2 plugins: **[AuthMe](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/authme-reloaded)** and **[CommandSpy](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/commandspy.18498/)**.
Type `/commandspy` into chat, and wait for the victim to go on your server. After he registered, if it's not obviously fake, you can try if it's their real password.
