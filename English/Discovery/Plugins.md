# Plugins

### Overview
Plugins are a key essential to Minecraft servers, and server griefers can exploit certain plugins.
To view plugins, there are a few exploits.

### Exploiting

One of the most popular method for finding plugins, is a TabCompletion exploit.
A list of clients with this exploit built in:

Type `/help` in chat and then press `TAB`. If you did it right, it may display a list of plugins depending if the server allows UserTabCompletion.
